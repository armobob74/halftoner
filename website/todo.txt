add a "view channels" button that redirects user to another page
	--> this would save a lot of data

add safety checks for the files being uploaded
	--> how big is too big? [done -- 1024 px limit]
	--> we're sure nothing malicious is accepted, right? [lol]
	--> make sure they submit something!! [TODO]

[done] add form so users can set spacing, angle, and perhaps dot shape
[done] add this to the results page too


[todo] find a way to stop saving files on the server
	--> Image.open() will work directly on werkzeug FileStorage objects
	--> but how do you send an image directly to html page?
	--> and how do I give option to see channels if image not saved?
		--> maybe do channel stuff on front-end?

[todo] move halftone thing to front-end
	--> long-term goal incase I need to scale this thing
	--> would require either using or creating a js halftone library
