add a "view channels" button that redirects user to another page
	--> this would save a lot of data

add safety checks for the files being uploaded
	--> how big is too big?
	--> we're sure nothing malicious is accepted, right?

add form so users can set spacing, angle, and perhaps dot shape

add "redo" option that includes different settings
